\title{Add New Points to an Existing Embedding}
\usage{
umap_transform(X, model, init_weighted = TRUE, search_k = NULL,
  n_epochs = NULL, n_threads = max(1,
  RcppParallel::defaultNumThreads()/2), grain_size = 1,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The new data to be transformed, either a matrix of data frame. Must
have the same columns in the same order as the input data used to generate
the \code{model}.}

\item{model}{Data associated with an existing embedding.}

\item{init_weighted}{If \code{TRUE}, then initialize the embedded coordinates
of \code{X} using a weighted average of the coordinates of the nearest
neighbors from the original embedding in \code{model}, where the weights
used are the edge weights from the UMAP smoothed knn distances. Otherwise,
use an unweighted average.}

\item{search_k}{Number of nodes to search during the neighbor retrieval. The
larger k, the more the accurate results, but the longer the search takes.
Default is the value used in building the \code{model} is used.}

\item{n_epochs}{Number of epochs to use during the optimization of the
embedded coordinates. A value between \code{30 - 100} is a reasonable trade
off between speed and thoroughness. By default, this value is set to one
third the number of epochs used to build the \code{model}.}

\item{n_threads}{Number of threads to use. Default is half that recommended
by RcppParallel.}

\item{grain_size}{Minimum batch size for multithreading. If the number of
items to process in a thread falls below this number, then no threads will
be used. Used in conjunction with \code{n_threads}.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, log details to the console.}
}
\value{
A matrix of coordinates for \code{X} transformed into the space
  of the \code{model}.
}
\description{
Carry out an embedding of new data using an existing embedding. Requires
using the result of calling \code{\link{umap}} or \code{\link{tumap}} with
\code{ret_model = TRUE}.
