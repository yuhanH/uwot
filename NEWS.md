# uwot 0.0.0.9002 (August 14 2018)

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* `metric = "cosine"` is working again for `n_threads` greater than `0`. 

# uwot 0.0.0.9001

## New features

* *August 5 2018*. You can now use an existing embedding to add new points via
`umap_transform`. See the example section below.

* *August 1 2018*. Numerical vectors are now supported for supervised dimension reduction.

* *July 31 2018*. (Very) initial support for supervised dimension reduction:
categorical data only at the moment. Pass in a factor vector (use `NA` for
unknown labels) as the `y` parameter and edges with bad (or unknown) labels are
down-weighted, hopefully leading to better separation of classes. This works
remarkably well for the Fashion MNIST dataset.

* *July 22 2018*. You can now use the cosine and Manhattan distances with the
Annoy nearest neighbor search, via `metric = "cosine"` and `metric =
"manhattan"`, respectively. Hamming distance is not supported because RcppAnnoy
doesn't yet support it.
