Version: 0.0.0.9010
Authors@R: person("James", "Melville", email = "jlmelville@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The dimensionality reduction method UMAP 
  (McInnes and Healy, 2018, <arxiv:1802.03426>). It is similar 
  to, but faster than, the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) 
  method.
